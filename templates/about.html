                  <h3>Who I am</h3>
                  <p>	 I'm a curious teenager and high school student from Zabrze, Poland, who is fascinated by IT technologies and the possibilities they offer.
                     My first brush with coding happened back in primary school, thanks to my math teacher, who was convincing his students to come after classes to an IT club and take a part in C++ lessons he was giving.
                     I accepted the invitation and, looking back, I see it was a milestone. It was then that I realised coding is logical and powerful, but more importantly- fun and extremely addictive.
                  <h3>What happened next</h3>
                  <p>
                    When I was already in secondary school, I took a subject called 'basics of programming'. That's where I began my journey with Python.
                    I was initially thrilled about the classes, but I soon noticed that the pace of learning was pretty slow, and due to unequal expirience levels in my class we weren't going anywhere.
                    I knew I had to be considerate, but I also wanted to aquire coding skills at the same time, so I took the matters in my own hands. </p>
                   </p>
                  <h3>My self-development path</h3>   </h3>
                  <p>Currently, I'm developing my Python skills through an online course from <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-python/">ZtM</a>, where I created along many fascinating projects
                  and still have a couple of others in store. As my next step I plan to dive in Python in Business course </p>
                  <p>
